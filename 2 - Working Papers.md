#### Research Project: What motivates Gen Z economic behavior?
* Social media, along with significant changes in established media platforms have obscured understanding
of how Gen Z determines consumption decisions. This is further complicated by the increased use of
artificial intelligence within media channels to individualize the consumer experience. In addition, the use
of stimulus and immersive experience threatens the viability of standard marketing practices going
forward, as these methods promote hormonal level connection between a product and the target
consumer.
* Though data is available on Gen Z consumption behavior, much of the present analysis is limited due to
single channel focus, and implicit exclusion of the social norms defining the generation. Further most
studies address Gen Z in aggregate rather than the individual self-selection that arguably separates this
generation from its predecessors.
* The present research study provides an entry point and insights into the significance of channel specific
marketing. The data for the study is collected from three high school cohorts located in three states:
California, Maryland, and Massachusetts and includes the development of a survey and comprehensive
literature review. In addition, this study is conducted with Gen Z research assistants, making the focus
more representative of the language and evolving influences that affect Gen Z behavior. The research
project is designed to be fully replicable, meaning that it can be repeated across geographies and
institutions. A larger study will require external funding.
*The study does address present limitations in the literature, which at the present time is dominated by paid
studies from consulting firms. The research from this study will be able to address the following
questions:
 What motivates Gen Z?
 How important is sustainability in Gen Z decision-making?
 What is the speed of generational divide given the catalyst of technology, including emerging AI?

#### AI Adoption in Banking: Efficiency Gains and Employment Trade-offs (with Eren Cifi, PhD)
* The rapid advancement and integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) across various industries has sparked growing interest in its transformative potential. Among these sectors, the banking industry stands out as a critical area where AI applications are becoming increasingly prevalent. From customer service automation to fraud detection and risk assessment, AI technologies are being deployed to streamline operations and enhance service delivery. However, despite its expanding role, the broader implications of AI, particularly its effectiveness in improving operational outcomes and its socio-economic impact, remain underexplored in academic and policy discussions.
* This project aims to contribute to this growing body of knowledge by examining the role of AI in shaping consumer experiences and employment dynamics within the banking sector. Using a comprehensive dataset of consumer complaints reported between 2012 and 2024, we investigate whether the adoption of AI has contributed to improved banking efficiency, as reflected by a reduction in customer grievances. At the same time, we assess the potential downside of AI deployment, particularly its association with job displacement and rising unemployment in an industry historically reliant on human labor. By exploring both the benefits and potential costs of AI integration, this study provides a balanced perspective on the evolving role of AI in modern banking.

#### Tornadoes and Financial Resilience: Assessing the Effects of Natural Disasters on Community Banks (with Eren Cifi, PhD)
* Natural disasters such as tornadoes, floods, and wildfires are recurring challenges in many parts of the United States. These events can inflict severe damage on local communities, destroying homes, businesses, and infrastructure, and even resulting in loss of life. Beyond the immediate human and structural toll, such disasters also pose significant risks to the local economy. In particular, community banks, many of which are deeply tied to local real estate markets through mortgage and commercial property lending, may experience acute financial strain. The collapse of property values and rising loan defaults following a disaster can jeopardize the stability of these institutions.
* This study examines the impact of tornadoes on the financial performance and operational resilience of local banks. By analyzing changes in bank returns and efficiency measures before and after tornado events, the research seeks to understand how these shocks affect community-based financial institutions. In doing so, we also explore the factors that determine which banks manage to weather such crises and which fail to recover. Understanding these dynamics is essential for improving risk management strategies, informing policy interventions, and enhancing the long-term resilience of the banking sector in disaster-prone regions.
